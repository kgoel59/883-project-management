The potential net savings via cost reduction strategies, potentially save $20 per full-time employee each year for four years. The realistic technology by tracking and analysing healthcare costs which involves managing data with the current intranet and integrating data from existing systems. In-house expertise, the ITS department has the expertise to develop and implement the application. However, the upfront costs for this project are estimated to be $100,000 which is reasonable, but potential resistance is a consideration.

The Web-Enhanced Communications System project has an attractive potential net savings estimate; for the three years following deployment, it will save about $2 million annually. Realistic technology, the technology requests for a web-enhanced communications system is realistic and feasible. Even though it ties to business strategy with the company's target to improve collaboration, communication and streamline processes with customers and suppliers. But not directly reducing internal costs. The upfront costs for this project are estimated to be $3 million, the initial investment is enormous. Nevertheless, In-House Expertise, the expertise required for developing a web- based system, but the complexity of the project and maintenance might require extra resources or expertise. Potential Resistance, this project might face resistance from employees, customers, and suppliers due to adapt to new systems, processes workflows.

Recreation and Wellness Intranet project promote employee health and save internal expenses, intranet projects develop in their connections with company strategy. Significant cost savings are possible due to the potential net savings, which are at least $30 for each full-time employee annually for four years. The upfront costs are evaluated to be $200,000, the hidden long-term cost savings and employee well-being benefits. In-house Expertise, the project might require developing some applications for employees to register activities and track healthcare programs. It should be consulted and cooperated with external health experts. Realistic Technology, the project requirements are considered realistic and feasible by developing an intranet application for employee well-being. Potential resistance, the project may encounter moderate resistance during its implementation, but the potential benefits and incentives offered could help mitigate resistance.

The Recreation and Wellness Intranet project's business case

Context

A healthcare company called Manage Your Health, Inc. (MYH) is listed by Fortune as one of the top 500 global corporations. Employees in MYH are around 20,000 full-time staff members and over 5,000 part-timers. Diminished internal costs, increased product cross- selling, and making use of new Web-based technologies to assist employees, customers, and suppliers in working collaboratively to improve the development and delivery of healthcare products and services are the main objectives of MYH's strategic strategy.

Business objective

MYH introduces the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project, which will cost about
$200,000 and take six months to complete. Its objectives are as follows:

* Enhance the health and well-being of employees.
* Negotiate lower insurance premiums to decrease healthcare expenditures.
* Promote employee engagement by implementing wellness programmes and recreational activities.
* Use web-based tools to ensure smooth communication between staff, clients, and suppliers, use web-based tools.

Problem statement

Being a company providing global healthcare services, MYH is put in a situation to reduce healthcare expenses. Due to the deteriorating health of its employees, MYH currently faces difficulties with healthcare expenditures that are 20% more than the industry average for employee healthcare premiums. The Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project aims to

solve this problem by promoting healthier lives among staff members, which saves healthcare costs.

Critical assumption and constraints

The application must offer substantial value by addressing the pressing issue of increasing healthcare costs and poor employee health within MYH's workforce. The effective implementation of the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project depends on active employee participation in the offered programs, which will result in healthy behaviour changes.
The Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project is limited by a set budget of $200,000 and a completion target of six months. The technical capabilities of the IT and development team must meet project requirements. Successful implementation depends on overcoming potential resistance to change among employees and ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. The project's scope is also constrained by legal and regulatory constraints.

Analysis of options and recommendation

* Option 1: Do Nothing

o Cons: Missed opportunity to address rising healthcare costs and employee health issues. Lack of proactive approach to well-being.
* Option 2: Purchase an Existing Application
o Pros: Faster implementation with potential for tested features.
o Cons: Upfront costs for licensing, potential misalignment with specific needs, limited customization.
* Option 3: Design and Implement the Application
o Pros: Customizable to fit MYH's unique requirements and objectives. Full control over features, functionality, and user experience.
o Cons: Longer development timeline, initial investment needed.

Recommendation:

Considering discussions with management, Option 3: Design and Implement the Application, is the preferred choice. While it requires an initial investment, the benefits of a customized solution that aligns with MYH's goals and integrates well with existing systems outweigh the drawbacks. This proactive approach will allow MYH to effectively address healthcare costs and employee health concerns, leading to long-term benefits for the organization.

Preliminary project requirements

* Develop a user-friendly intranet application with features for program registration, participation tracking, and incentive management.
* Offer recreational programs (e.g., soccer, softball, jogging) and health-management classes (e.g., weight management, stress reduction) within the application.
* Ensure data security and privacy compliance.

PART 8: PROJECT CLOSING AND LESSONS-LEARNED
Tast 1.

All the specified success criteria for the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project were satisfied:

Scope: The project developed a web-based application that records employee activity, provides rewards, and enables staff members to sign up for company-sponsored classes, leisure activities, and health-management programs.

Time: In consistent with the initial plan, the project was finished in six months.

Cost: The project stayed within the original budget of $200,000.

Self-sufficiency: The project achieved self-sufficiency within one year of implementation, meaning that the revenue generated from the incentive program is now covering the cost of maintaining and operating the application.

Critical lessons learned: Managing the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project taught the project team some important lessons:

* Be proactive in managing stakeholder expectations. It is important to keep stakeholders informed of the project progress and any changes to the plan, even if they are not directly involved in the day-to-day work. This helps to avoid surprises and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

* Use a variety of communication channels to reach stakeholders. Not everyone prefers the same way to communicate. Some stakeholders may prefer email, while others may prefer face-to-face meetings or phone calls. It is important to use a variety of communication channels to ensure that everyone can stay informed.

* Create a detailed project plan and budget. This will help to keep the project on track and avoid overspending. In order to ensure that the project plan and budget are still valid, it is also crucial to keep monitoring them.
* Conduct thorough testing of the application before launch. This will help to identify and fix any bugs or usability issues. It is also important to get feedback from users before launching the application to ensure that it meets their needs.
* Track and measure the success of the application. This will help to identify what is working well and what needs to be improved. It is also important to share the success of the application with stakeholders to show them the value of the project.

Tast 2.

Examples of what went right:

* Effective collaboration with stakeholders: The project team established a robust rapport with stakeholders, facilitating the comprehensive definition of requirements. This engagement ensured that the final product seamlessly aligned with users' needs. For instance, conducting an employee survey provided invaluable insights into recreational programs, health-management classes, and incentives.
* Methodical project management: The team's adherence to a structured project management methodology proved instrumental in project success. The utilization of tools like Gantt charts for scheduling and risk registers for risk assessment and mitigation ensured that the project adhered to timelines and goals.
* Rigorous application testing: Prior to the official launch, the project team rigorously tested the application, uncovering and rectifying bugs and usability concerns. User acceptance testing, involving a select group of employees, was conducted to gather feedback and refine the application before its organization-wide deployment.
* Proactive application promotion: To guarantee the application's success, the team actively promoted it among employees. Creating a dedicated website, establishing a social media presence, and sending out informative email announcements encouraged its adoption.
* We implemented Confluence as our primary document management system for this project, and it proved to be a highly effective and indispensable tool. Confluence, as a collaborative workspace, offered a wide range of features that greatly enhanced our project's document management capabilities.

Examples of what went wrong.

* One challenge encountered was underestimating the time required for application development and launch. For instance, the team miscalculated the development duration for the data tracking system, necessitating last-minute efforts, and causing stress to meet the deadline.
* The departure of key team members for better opportunities resulted in delays and knowledge gaps. The absence of suitable backups for these experts led to the recruitment of new employees, incurring additional delays and costs.

What we might change for the upcoming project

We would approach the next project differently, having learned from our experience with the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project:

* Keep stakeholders informed about the team's composition and any potential hazards early and frequently. Expectations will be better managed and unpleasant surprises

will be avoided. Stakeholders would be updated on project progress and any modifications to the plan through frequent status meetings. Additionally, we would give out frequent email updates.
* By determining the maximum buffer period, we can create a project schedule and budget that are more specific. By doing this, delays and wasteful money would be reduced.
* Identify the main players on the team and create backup plans for each position. This can need instructing more team members on the relevant skills, or it might entail using consultants to cover for absent team members.

We believe that with the identified solution for multiple issues based on this project, we can ensure that future projects are successful.

Additional thoughts

Throughout our project's duration, we saw a notable level of accomplishment, with teamwork and structured organization taking centre stage. A cornerstone of this achievement was our adoption of collaborative tech tools. Primarily, GitHub emerged as our chief project coordination platform, harmoniously working alongside Microsoft 365's comprehensive toolkit, with a special nod to Microsoft Project. Tasks were systematically listed on a GitHub project board, allowing team members to pick and assign tasks based on consensus during team discussions. They could also update their statuses and benchmark their pace against predetermined deadlines. Many assignments were prepared using cloud versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, and Project, and completed tasks were archived in a shared folder on Microsoft OneDrive. These platforms made it possible to assign tasks and monitor progress, which encouraged members to take responsibility for their actions. The real-time updating feature and the capacity for simultaneous collaborative efforts minimized potential lags in our timeline, leading to a smooth, timely, and harmonious working environment.
