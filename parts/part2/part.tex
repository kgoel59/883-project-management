\chapter{Project Scope Management}

In this part, we will detail the project scope, clearly defining what is included and what is excluded from the project. We will also describe the development of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and the Gantt chart for this project. These tools are essential for ensuring that the project remains focused on its intended goals and is executed efficiently without unnecessary expansion or deviation. By establishing these parameters, we aim to provide a structured approach to managing the project's scope, facilitating better control over project deliverables and timelines.


\section{Stakeholder Identification}
The first step before developing the project scope is to identify all stakeholders. This process ensures that the needs and expectations of every individual or group affected by the project are considered from the outset.

The stakeholders identified for the project are listed in Table \ref{tab:stakeholders}.

\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Stakeholder} & \textbf{Role/Interest} \\
\hline
Employees & Direct beneficiaries, interested in wellness programs and facilities \\
\hline

\hline
Senior Management & Strategic oversight and funding decisions \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Requirements Analysis}

The next step in developing the project scope is to gather and list the requirements necessary for project completion. In this section, we will detail the requirement gathering process and present the requirements in a Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM). This matrix will help ensure that each requirement is clearly linked to project objectives and can be traced throughout the project lifecycle.


\subsection{Requirements Gathering}

To ensure a thorough evaluation of all system aspects relevant to the project, requirements have been collected from various sources using diverse methods:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Stakeholder Interviews:} In-depth interviews with identified stakeholders are conducted to obtain detailed insights into their specific requirements and expectations.
    \item \textbf{Employee Surveys:} Surveys are distributed among employees to gather a broad spectrum of data on their perspectives and needs.
    \item \textbf{Focus Groups:} Focus group discussions are organized to explore particular issues or topics of interest in greater depth with a select group of stakeholders.
    \item \textbf{Review of Existing Systems and Data:} Current systems and historical data are analyzed to establish a baseline and identify potential areas for improvement.
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking:} Investigated and compared existing wellness programs or applications in other organizations to identify best practices and innovative features that could be incorporated into our project.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirement Traceability Matrix}

Once the requirements have been collected, we constructed a Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) to map each requirement back to its source. This matrix serves as a critical tool for ensuring that all requirements are clearly linked to their origins and that they are fully addressed throughout the project lifecycle. 

Table \ref{tab:rtm} list the Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) with its source and links it to specific features.

\section{Project Scope Statement - Version 1}

This section presents the initial version of the project scope statement as created by the project manager. The document outlines key project objectives, deliverables, and the overall approach.

\section{Work Breakdown Structure}

We developed a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to systematically organize and define the total scope of the project. This structure delineates all key deliverables and breaks them down into manageable components, facilitating more effective planning and execution. 

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for our project is meticulously organized into five distinct phases, each tailored to ensure structured progress and effective management throughout the project lifecycle. These phases are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initiation:} This initial phase focuses on formally starting the project. Key activities include defining project scope, identifying stakeholders, and securing necessary approvals. The goal is to set clear expectations and foundations for project success.

    \item \textbf{Planning:} In this critical phase, detailed plans are developed to guide the project's execution. It encompasses setting up timelines, budgets, resources, and defining the project management plans. This phase ensures that every aspect of the project is thoroughly mapped out, from resource allocation to risk management strategies.

    \item \textbf{Execution:} During the execution phase, the plans created in the previous stages are implemented. This phase involves the coordination of people and resources to carry out the project tasks. It is the phase where deliverables are created and completed as per the project plan.

    \item \textbf{Monitoring and Control:} Concurrent with the execution phase, this stage focuses on tracking the project's progress and performance to ensure it remains on track and within scope. It involves regular monitoring of project variables (cost, effort, scope, etc.) against the project plan and the project performance baseline.

    \item \textbf{Closure:} This final phase marks the completion of the project. Activities include the formal termination of contracts, completion of paperwork, delivery of the project deliverables to the customer, and the release of project resources. The project team may also conduct a post-mortem meeting to document lessons learned and provide insights for future projects.

    \item \textbf{Post-Project Evaluation:} After the project closure, this phase involves evaluating the project outcomes against the initial objectives and goals. It's essential for assessing the project's success, understanding its impacts, and deriving valuable lessons that can improve future project endeavors.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these phases plays a crucial role in the structured and successful delivery of the project, ensuring all objectives are met and the project delivers the intended benefits.
