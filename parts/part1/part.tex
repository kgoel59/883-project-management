\section{Objectives}

MYH is a fortune 500 company with more than 20,000 full-time employees. Their strategic plan have three key goals in mind as follows

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Business Costs Reduction}: Reduce internal expenses to improve efficiency and profitability.
    \item \textbf{Business Growth}: Expand market reach and revenue by increasing cross-selling opportunities.
    \item \textbf{Employees and Customer Growth}: Foster better collaboration among employees, customers, and suppliers by using new web-based technologies, thereby improving the development and delivery of healthcare products and services.
\end{enumerate}

In response to these challenges, the client has presented three potential solutions and has requested us to conduct a preliminary analysis to determine which option best aligns with their needs:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
    \item \textbf{Health Coverage Costs Business Model:} Develop a secure application to model and analyze healthcare expenses. Although this tool has an initial development cost of \$100,000, it is expected to save \$20 per full-time employee annually.

    \item \textbf{Web-Enhanced Communications System:} Create a web-based system to streamline product development and delivery. This system is projected to save \$2 million annually, with a development cost of \$3 million and annual maintenance expenses.
